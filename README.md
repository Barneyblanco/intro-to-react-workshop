# Intro to React Workshop

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and uses [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) for a quick base set of styles and components.

This project is intended to help newcomers to React in learning how to implement some of the more common patterns used with component-based development. It's also intended to help those that have been working with the library for a while, but have perhaps never gotten deeper than basic components. It will teach you strategies for wrapping general imperative-style APIs as declarative components, applying transformations to existing components, certain optimizations to help improve application performance, the basics of hooking an application up to Redux for global state management, and some of the basics of testing React applications with Jest, Enzyme, and Cypress.

To get up and running quickly, simply follow these steps:

### Fork the repository

Login to GitHub and visit [https://github.com/Velveeta/intro-to-react-workshop](https://github.com/Velveeta/intro-to-react-workshop), then click the `Fork` button in the upper-right corner.

### Clone the repository

Visit your own copy of this repository and click the green `Clone or download` button to display the clone path. Copy this to your clipboard, then use your utility of choice (terminal, Sourcetree, etc.) to clone the repository to your desired location on disk.

### Install dependencies

From within the root of the project directory, run `yarn` or `npm install` to install the project dependencies.

### Run the project

From within the root of the project directory, run `yarn start` or `npm start` to run the application. It should automatically launch your browser to the right location, but if it doesn't, you can just open a page to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the Jest test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn test:e2e`

Launches the Cypress test runner in headless/CI mode.
See the section about the [Cypress run command](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line.html#cypress-run) for more information.

### `yarn test:e2e:dev`

Launches the Cypress test runner in the interactive mode.
See the section about the [Cypress open command](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line.html#cypress-open) for more information.
